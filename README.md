# Ruby Project

Just a default project I can use as a ruby template for stuff. Trying to include all the good stuff off the bat.

### Quickstart  
To use this as a template for a new ruby project do this..  
1. Clone this project.  
2. Rename the directory to your new project
3. `bundle install --path vendor`  
4. Start Coding

### Included
* Rspec -> Defacto standard testing library. http://rspec.info/
* Rubocop -> A Ruby static code analyzer, based on the community Ruby style guide. http://rubocop.readthedocs.io  
* Guard Rspec -> Guard is a command line tool to easily handle events on file system modifications. https://github.com/guard/guard-rspec
* pry -> An IRB alternative and runtime developer console. http://pryrepl.org/  
* simplecov -> Test code coverage metrics. https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov

### Anatomy of this Project  
TODO Describe how this is set up and why maybe.

### Testing
**Rspec**  
TODO: How to use Rspec + links to test examples

**Guard Rspec**  
TODO: How to use Guard Rspec.  

### Vendoring Gems  
It's good practice to keep your projects dependencies local to this project.  
To vendor your gems localy simply run `bundle install --path vendor`  
The `vendor/ruby` should be git ignored too.  

#### TODO's
* Good example of module documentation comment.  
* Good example of class documentation comment.
* Good example of Rdoc (or similar)
* Gemspec for building and publishing gems.  
* other dirs for stuff .. like in http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex46.html  
* more detail around Rake and how to write Rake tasks  
* More thorough testing examples. Mocks?  
* (More difficult) Create a gem to scaffold this out.
